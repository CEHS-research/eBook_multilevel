### [Parent couples' participation in speech-language therapy for school-age children with autism spectrum disorder in the United States](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361319862113)

-   **Terms**: ICC, multilevel models

-   **Design**: parent-child dyad, mother and father nested under child

-   **Levels**: Two-level multilevel models with parent dyad (father and mother) at Level 1 (*n* = 80) and child at Level 2 (*n* = 40), mother--father pairs were nested within child

-   **Software**: HLM (Version 7.01) using restricted maximum likelihood

-   **Centering**: Binary variables were entered uncentered and continuous variables were grand mean centered

-   **Steps**: Null for ICC, Random intercepts (no random slopes), residual diagnostics

-   **Missing Data**: small proportion of missing data, composite variables were imputed using the expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm

-   **Results**: Table with 3 MLM models, discussed moderation

## Longitudianl or Repeated Measures

### [Examining the Links Between Received Network Support and Marital Quality Among Mothers of Children with ASD: A Longitudinal Mediation Analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-019-04330-4)

-   **Terms**: multilevel modeling (MLM), longitudinal multiple mediation models

-   **Design**: cohort sequential (accelerated longitudinal) design

-   **Levels**: time (child age) specified at Level 1 and mothers at Level 2

-   **Software**: SPSS 25.0 with *MLmed*, a macro which tests for mediation and moderated mediation in multilevel data

-   **Steps**: Null for ICC, add fixed effects, mediation...simultaneous estimation of all indirect effects included in each model (calculated as *a* × *b*), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Monte Carlo bootstrapping estimates being used to determine significant indirect effects. Covariance matrix designated as unstructured. Restricted maximum likelihood

-   **Centering**: time-varying predictors and mediators were **disaggregated** into their constituent within and between-person effects. To assess within-person effects, Level 1 predictors were created by **person-mean centering** each predictor or mediator (i.e., subtracting each mother's cross-time mean score on a predictor from her actual score on that measure). Level 2 predictors were created by first computing a cross-time **mean** score on a predictor for each mother and then **grand-mean centering** that score. Finally, baseline child problem behavior severity was **grand-mean centered** with a mean of zero.
