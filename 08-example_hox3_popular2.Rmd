## Background

```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
The text **"Multilevel Analysis: Techniques and Applications, Third Edition"** [@hox2017] has a companion [website](https://multilevel-analysis.sites.uu.nl/) which includes links to all the data files used throughout the book (housed on the [book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/MultiLevelAnalysis)).  
```


The following example is used through out @hox2017's chapater 2.

> From **Appendix E**:  
>
> The popularity data in **popular2.sav** are simulated data for **2000 pupils in 100 schools**. The purpose is to offer a very simple example for multilevel regression analysis.  The main outcome variable is the **pupil popularity**, a popularity rating on a scale of 1-10 derived by a sociometric procedure. Typically, a sociometric procedure asks all pupils in a class to rate all the other pupils, and then assigns the average received popularity rating to each pupil.  Because of the sociometric procedure, group effects as apparent from higher level variance components are rather strong. There is a second outcome variable: **pupil popularity** as rated by their teacher, on a scale from 1-10.  The explanatory variables are **pupil gender** (boy=0, girl=1), **pupil extraversion** (10-point scale) and **teacher experience** in years.  The popularity data have been generated to be a 'nice' well-behaved data set: the sample sizes at both levels are sufficient, the residuals have a normal distribution, and the multilevel effects are strong.

## Grand-Mean-Centering and Standardizing Variables


It is best to manually determine the variable's mean (`mean()`) and standard deviation (`sd()`).

```{r}
mean(data_pop$extrav)
sd(data_pop$extrav)
```


### Grand-Mean-Centering

$$
VAR_G = VAR - mean(VAR)
$$


### Standardizing

$$
VAR_Z = \frac{VAR - mean(VAR)}{sd(VAR)}
$$




```{r}
data_pop <- data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(extravG =  extrav - 5.215) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(extravZ = (extrav - 5.215) / 1.262368)
```




```{r, include = FALSE}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::select(extrav, extravG, extravZ) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  stargazer::stargazer(title  = "Descriptive statistics: Three versions of Extraversion",
                       header = FALSE,
                       type   = "text")
```

```{r, results="asis"}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::select(extrav, extravG, extravZ) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  stargazer::stargazer(title  = "Descriptive statistics: Three versions of Extraversion",
                       header = FALSE,
                       type   = "html")
```

```




### Investigating a MLM-RI Model



```{r}
pop_lmer_1_raw %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```


```{r}
pop_lmer_1_raw %>% 
  broom::glance()
```


```{r}
pop_lmer_1_raw %>% 
  broom::augment() %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per observation (2000 students)
```





#### Fixed Effects: intercept and slope

There is only ONE fixed intercept and ONE fixed slope.

The `fixef()` function extracts the estimates of the fixed effects.


```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw) 
```

```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]
```

```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["extrav"]]
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = extrav,
      y = popular,
      group = class) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = "black",
              size = .2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]],
              slope     = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["extrav"]],
              color = "hot pink",
              size = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  labs(title = "MLM-RI: Extroversion = raw score",
       subtitle = "Thin black lines are OLS regression ran independently on each class",
       x = "Student's Extroversion, as rated by their teacher",
       y = "Student's Populartity, mean rating by their peers") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10),
                  ylim = c(0, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2))
```




#### Random Effects: intercepts

There is a different random intercept for EACH CLASS.  These tell how far each class's average is off of the grand average.

The `ranef()` function extracts the random effects from a fitted model object

```{r}
ranef(pop_lmer_1_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
ranef(pop_lmer_1_raw)$class %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per group (100 classes)
```

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.25}
ranef(pop_lmer_1_raw)$class %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Random_Intercepts = "(Intercept)") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Random_Intercepts)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25)
```


#### Predictions


```{r}
predict(pop_lmer_1_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
predict(pop_lmer_1_raw) %>% 
  head()                  # onle value per observation (2000 students)
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pred = predict(pop_lmer_1_raw)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = extrav,
             y = pred,
             group = class)) +
  geom_line(size = .2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]],
              slope     = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["extrav"]],
              color = "hot pink",
              size = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.215,
             color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MLM-RI: Extroversion = raw score",
       subtitle = "Thin black lines are group-wise predictions, one per class",
       x = "Student's Extroversion, as rated by their teacher",
       y = "Predicted\nStudent's Populartity, mean rating by their peers") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10),
                  ylim = c(0, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2))
```



#### Combined Effects

The `coef()` function computes the sum of the random and fixed effects coefficients for each explanatory variable for each level of each grouping factor.

```{r}
coef(pop_lmer_1_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
coef(pop_lmer_1_raw)$class %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per group (100 classes)
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pred = predict(pop_lmer_1_raw)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = extrav,
      y = pred,
      group = class) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0 - 0.25, 
                xmax = 0 + 0.25,
                ymin = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]- 2.5,
                ymax = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]+ 2.5),
            fill = "yellow",
            alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_abline(data = coef(pop_lmer_1_raw)$class %>% dplyr::rename(Intercept = "(Intercept)"),
              aes(intercept = Intercept,
                  slope     = extrav),
              color = "gray",
              size = .1) +
  geom_line(size = .2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["(Intercept)"]],
              slope     = fixef(pop_lmer_1_raw)[["extrav"]],
              color = "hot pink",
              size = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.215,
             color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MLM-RI: Extroversion = raw score",

1. Grand-Mean Centering a Predictor    

* Different than when using the Raw Predictor:    
    + fixed intercept
    + random estimates, i.e. variance and covariance components, includin the residual variance
    
* Same as when using the Raw Predictor: 
    + fixed estimates or slopes for all predictors (main effects and interactions)    
    + model fit statistics, including AIC, BIC, and the Log Loikelihood (-2LL or deviance)
    

2. Standardize a Predictor    

* Different than when using the Raw Predictor:    
    + fixed intercept (same as if using the grand-mean centered predictor)    
    + fixed estimate (slope) for that variable
    + random estimates, i.e. variance and covariance components, includin the residual variance  
    
* Stays the SAME:

### Investigating a MLM-RI Model


```{r}
pop_lmer_2_raw %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```


```{r}
pop_lmer_2_raw %>% 
  broom::glance()
```


```{r}
pop_lmer_2_raw %>% 
  broom::augment() %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per observation (2000 students)
```





#### Fixed Effects: intercept and slope

There is only ONE fixed intercept and ONE fixed slope.

The `fixef()` function extracts the estimates of the fixed effects.


```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw) 
```

```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]
```

```{r}
fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["extrav"]]
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = extrav,
      y = popular,
      group = class) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = "black",
              size = .2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["(Intercept)"]],
              slope     = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["extrav"]],
              color = "hot pink",
              size = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.215,
             color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MLM-RIAS: Extroversion = raw score",
       subtitle = "Thin black lines are OLS regression ran independently on each class",
       x = "Student's Extroversion, as rated by their teacher",
       y = "Student's Populartity, mean rating by their peers") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10),
                  ylim = c(0, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2))
```



#### Random Effects: intercepts

There is a different random intercept AND random slope for EACH CLASS.  These tell how far each class's average is off of the grand average AND how far each class's slope is off of the grand average sope.

The `ranef()` function extracts the random effects from a fitted model object

```{r}
ranef(pop_lmer_2_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
ranef(pop_lmer_2_raw)$class %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per group (100 classes)
```

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.25}
ranef(pop_lmer_2_raw)$class %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Random_Intercepts = "(Intercept)") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Random_Intercepts)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.25}
ranef(pop_lmer_2_raw)$class %>% 
  ggplot(aes(extrav)) +
  geom_histogram()
```




#### Predictions


```{r}
predict(pop_lmer_2_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
predict(pop_lmer_2_raw) %>% 
  head()                  # onle value per observation (2000 students)
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pred = predict(pop_lmer_2_raw)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = extrav,
             y = pred,
             group = class)) +
  geom_line(size = .2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["(Intercept)"]],
              slope     = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["extrav"]],
              color = "hot pink",
              size = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.215,
             color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MLM-RIAS: Extroversion = raw score",
       subtitle = "Thin black lines are group-wise predictions, one per class",
       x = "Student's Extroversion, as rated by their teacher",
       y = "Predicted\nStudent's Populartity, mean rating by their peers") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10),
                  ylim = c(0, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2))
```




#### Combined Effects

The `coef()` function computes the sum of the random and fixed effects coefficients for each explanatory variable for each level of each grouping factor.

```{r}
coef(pop_lmer_1_raw) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r}
coef(pop_lmer_1_raw)$class %>% 
  head()                  # onle line per group (100 classes)
```


```{r}
data_pop %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pred = predict(pop_lmer_2_raw)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = extrav,
      y = pred,
      group = class) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0 - 0.25, 
                xmax = 0 + 0.25,
                ymin = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]- 4.5,
                ymax = fixef(pop_lmer_2_raw)[["(Intercept)"]]+ 4.5),
            fill = "yellow",
            alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_abline(data = coef(pop_lmer_2_raw)$class %>% dplyr::rename(Intercept = "(Intercept)"),
              aes(intercept = Intercept,
                  slope     = extrav),
              color = "gray",
              size = .1) +
