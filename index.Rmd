## Code and Output {-}

This is how $R$ code is shown:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

This is what the output of the $R$ code above will look:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# This is a Code Chunk
1 + 1
```




### Why choose R ?  {-}


```{block type='rmdlink', echo=TRUE}
**Check it out:** an article from Fall 2016... [No more excuses: R is better than SPSS for psychology undergrads, and students agree](https://datahowler.wordpress.com/2016/09/10/no-more-excuses-r-is-better-than-spss-for-psychology-undergrads-and-students-agree/)
```



### FYI  {-}

This entire encyclopedia is written in $R Markdown$, using $R Studio$ as the text editor and the `bookdown` package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole. The book's source code is hosted on GitHub. If you notice typos or other issues, feel free to email author.
